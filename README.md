  Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting. She would like out help to pull together data to present to her company. They would like to expand their portfolio invesments for their customers by offering Cryptocurrencies. 
  Martha supplied a data set that we loaded into Jupyter Notebook. Once it was loaded, we processed, cleaned, and filtered. The goal was to reflect currently traded/mined coins to give a glimpse of what is available for portfolios. This would allow Martha to narrow down her focus on what coins she needs to research.

We supplied a visual of a 3D model that Martha can use in her presentation.
