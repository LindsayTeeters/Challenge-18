  Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting. She would like out help to pull together data to present to her company. They would like to expand their portfolio invesments for their customers by offering Cryptocurrencies. 
  Martha supplied a data set that we loaded into Jupyter Notebook. Once loaded, we processed, cleaned, and filtered. The goal was to reflect currently traded/mined coins.
